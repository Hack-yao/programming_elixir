#Exercise: Nodes-4
#The ticker process in this chapter is a central server that sends events to
#registered clients. Reimplement this as a ring of clients. A client sends a
#tick to the next client in the ring. After 2 seconds, that client sends a tick
#to its next client. When thinking about how to add clients to the ring,
#remember to deal with the case where a clientâ€™s receive loop times out just as
#youâ€™re adding a new process. What does this say about who has to be responsible
#for updating the links?
